- Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using Minikube or AWS EKS).
- Write Kubernetes manifests for deployments, services, and pods.
- Expose the app using a LoadBalancer or NodePort service.

**Outcome:** A live app running on Kubernetes.

## CI/CD Project

**Project:** Build a CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

- **Objective:** Automate the build, test, and deployment of an app using Jenkins.

### Tasks:
- Set up Jenkins on a server or use a cloud-based Jenkins service.
